1  IF YOU WANT AN ANSWER IN INT BUT   INPUT  CONTAINS 2 VARIABLES A,B IN FORM OF DATATYPE DOUBLE AND THEN USE ANOTHER VARIABLE X TO TYPE CAST IT INTO

NEW DATATYPE INT BY DEFINING X DATATYPE AS INT 

DOUBLE A,B;

INT X;

X=A/B;

COUT<<X;

YOU GET ANSWER IN INT :-);

  in if else statement please note that inside if and else if statement not equal is same i.e is != we don"t write it as (!==0)---this is wrong

ok,

now for = statement in if else statements we use== as assignment operator i.e A%B==0 not single = to i.e (=)
